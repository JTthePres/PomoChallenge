# CSS Animated Search Box Concepts

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/brandonkennedy/pen/wvZWgg](https://codepen.io/brandonkennedy/pen/wvZWgg).

Just a few ideas i've had on animating search boxes.  All animations are triggered when the input is focused.  Minimal Javascript is used to set the focus and submit the form, but no actual form is used in these examples.  These are display examples only.
